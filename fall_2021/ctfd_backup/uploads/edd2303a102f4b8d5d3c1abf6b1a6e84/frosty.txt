Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul	  	 	     	   
With a corncob pipe and a button nose     	      	      	     	       
and two eyes made out of coal   	   	      	    	       	  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say	   	   	       	 
He was made of snow but the children   	      		       	    	     
know how he came to life one day
